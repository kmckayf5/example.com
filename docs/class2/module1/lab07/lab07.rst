Delegation
=================================

Delegate a subdomain of example.com to the BIG-IP DNS. Delegation is a means to 'defer' or assign management of a portion of your DNS namespace to another DNS server. When the DNS server receives a query for the delegated subdomain it will either recursively resolve the CNAME target, or respond with a referral.

Login to the local DNS server (this should already be open) from the jumpbox, and open the DNS management UI:
